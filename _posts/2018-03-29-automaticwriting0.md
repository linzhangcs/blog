For my soft circuit, I liked the overlaying layers of fabric look I tried in class. So I made a brooch that is based on the pattern of the fabric.

Once I cut out of the pattern I used fabric glue to adhere the two layers and sew the circuit into the the pattern

The ground side of the circuit was interesting to add, because I had to think about how to do it and also be able to hold the battery. Added an additional piece of fabric for and sew that end to the ground side of the LED.

Since it is a brooch, I originally thought I could use the safety pin as a switch when open and close it. However, I realized safety as a whole is conducive, so my originally idea did not work.

Regardless, I still connected the safety pin to the ground side to take advantage the fact that it is conducive. It can also help to secure the battery.

One more thing I learned from this process is the importance of sewing precise stitches and insulation. Some of the ground stitches got exposed on the side of the battery holder and was shorting the circuit. I added a bit of fabric to fix that, but the connection is still not as stable as I like.

Here is a video of my soft circuit in action:
