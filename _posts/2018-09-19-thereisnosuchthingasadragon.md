There’s No Such Thing As a Dragon is a book a children book. It about this boy, Billy, who discovers a dragon in his room. But his mom refuses to acknowledge the dragon. She does this by saying "there’s no such thing as a dragon" every time Billy mentions it.

The story develops as the dragon gets bigger and bigger as the mother continues to ignore it. Overall, The storyline is linear and short. I thought it fits the message of the story and drives it home if I provide some selections for the user while maintain the original story progression, so I made a linear twine story but with multiple choices.

That is how the twine story looks like in the editor:
