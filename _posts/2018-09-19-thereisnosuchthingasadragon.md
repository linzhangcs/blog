There’s No Such Thing As a Dragon is a book I read after it got referenced in a book I am currently reading. It is a children book and its message is very remarkable.

The storyline is linear. I thought it would fit the message of the story and drives it home if I provide some action selections for the user. So I made a linear twine story but with multiple choices.
