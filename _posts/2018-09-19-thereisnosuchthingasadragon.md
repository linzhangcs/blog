There’s No Such Thing As a Dragon is a children's book. It is about this boy, Billy, who discovers a dragon in his room. But his mom refuses to acknowledge the dragon. She does this by saying "there’s no such thing as a dragon" every time Billy mentions it. The story develops as the dragon gets bigger and bigger because his mother continues to ignore it.

I adapted this story for twine. The person who is playing will take the role of Billy. The situation does not change, but you can choose to do thing that ignore or acknowledge the dragon. Overall, The storyline is linear.

That is how the twine story looks like in the editor:
