Vesha's answer to the first question in 'What Does "Open Source" Even Mean' hits home for me. Like Vesha, I completed a computer science degree, worked as a developer for years. I use open source projects on a daily basis but I don't contribute. Partially, I don't know how to start, but I know that is a minor issue, because I can easily learn how to do that. The bigger problem is I suffer from impostor syndrome as a developer. When I unpack that and explain more precisely, the impostor syndrome emerged because I feel my work would not be considered good enough to be valued or used.

That opinion is not something I dreamed up; I have heard harsh comments in real life from coworkers. I invite constructive criticism, but there is a difference between correcting someone's mistake and using someone's mistake as an in to demean their contribution. I have had discussion with other developers about the culture norm within the community - how we treat and value other as developers and people. My personal experience is fairy common. When I read "Inessential Weirdness", the story on [Contempt Culture](https://blog.aurynn.com/2015/12/16-contempt-culture) pinpoints the emotion that is most problematic.

It calls out this behavior of showing contempt as a currency. A lot of developers I have met use contempt as a signal to others they are a part of the serious developers' club. This Contempt Culture shows up in all aspects of group dynamics. It does not stop at hating on a language or a operating system. It manifests as a general attitude. This culture gives permission for everyone in it to openly put others down. And this is a partial reason for so many developers have impostor syndrome. Developer community is ruthless. If you use the "wrong" language you will be judge harshly for it, let alone not be "competent".

Despite this, I still want to be a developer. I enjoy problem solving and knowing a system. It is fun. I will do my best to stop this attitude spread, starting with myself.
