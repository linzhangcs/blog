I scanned Jillian for this exercise. The process turned out to be pretty challenging. I tried to do the 3 layers technique. However, when I got to the outer most layer, scanning below the waist. Itseez3d had problem placing the arms. Here is the example of my failed yet funny scan:

Here is Jillian's scan of me. I noticed there is a hole on the top of my head. Also, my hands are pretty deformed. My legs and pants merged with the texture of the carpet.

Overall, this exercise made me realize how time consuming and difficult it is to get a good 3d scan.
