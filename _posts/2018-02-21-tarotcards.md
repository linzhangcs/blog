To design my own oracle deck, I thought about how oracle deck is visual representative of the meaning of the card.

Because I want to make an deck of electronic tarot cards, I want to incorporate the online tarot reading experience and internet culture into my deck. What is more representative of internet culture than gifs? I build an electronic deck with giphy API and JSON file of tarot info.
