I followed the instruction videos and everything went as expected. The resizing in Maya is very straightforward. Using Wrap3 was new to me, I was unsure how well the morph processing would go. Because my body type was very different from the base model. So I put around 36 points for the morph stage.
In the end, the base model morphed well with my model.

Here is the screen recoding of animating my model using Xiaomi:

I picked some interesting movements for animation:
