For midterm, I wanted to make flow field steering behavior. Also I want to see if I can generate interesting image with it.

I learned how to generate and draw a vector field from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY). After that, I want to time as a 3rd variable for getting Perlin noise, so the flow field will update each frame. For each of the vector, I also generate angle and length to update per frame. Here is the result:

Instead of drawing the vehicles moving and following the flow field, I want to draw the path the vehicles generate over time. I added functions to do drawing and update, and here is the result:
