For the flashlight project, I wanted to make a flashlight that is lightweight and easy to carry. With that goal in mind, I gravitated towards making small scale object and using soft materials. I came up with ideas like keychain made of cloth, pen flashlight, and paper lantern flashlight.

In the end, I decided on making a ribbon bracelet flashlight. Partially because I found a roll of ribbon and several electric candle light on the junk shelf!

## Making Process
I learned to make a basic ribbon bracelet from watching youtube videos.

Once I have the bracelet, I thought about the number of LEDs to use, and played around with the placement. I decided to use three LEDs and have them in the middle. After I made the design decisions, I worked on soldering the LED to resistors. I also tested them to make sure they were properly soldered.

The next step is to connect the three components and connect them to a switch and a power source. In this case I reused the switch and 3V battery from the electric candle light.

Once the three LEDs are connected, I made a battery holder. I attached the holder and the switch to the bracelet.

## User Testing

Once everything was put together, I wore my bracelet flashlight home as a way to test how well it worked. It is very lightweight and pretty easy to turn on and off. The light it offers works well in the dark.
