For this week's machine learning experiment, I looked into TensorFlow.js. One of the examples listed on its websites was Google Creative Lab's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). I enjoy using the project a lot, because it is very interactive: you can teach a set of behavior and use it for creative output.

In that project, you can teach the program to translate movements to gifs, English, and sounds. This idea of movements and expressions translation made me think of Emoji. I want to make a version of the program that translates human enactment of Emoji in expressions and movements to actual Emoji output.

Emoji has reached a point in our culture that it can be used as a language. There are [numerous](https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_Speak_Emoji.html?id=sELECwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) [books](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Emoji_To_English_Dictionary.html?id=RxKDCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) about how to use it, and [videos](https://youtu.be/2Xx4PV0kBdU?t=2m11s) of people [translating Emoji](https://youtu.be/8pMRmF89HQk?t=165) sentences. So it would be also very fun game to act out the Emoji and translate the meaning of that Emoji phrase or sentence. There is actually a mobile game called [Emoji Charades](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emoji-charades/id1085847205?mt=8) is about guessing Emoji meaning. Also there is a lot room for creativity of every person's enactment of emoji.

Teachable Machine project shared their [project code](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachable-machine) on github and even provided a [boilerplate](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachable-machine-boilerplate) project as well. I use it as the starting point of my project.
