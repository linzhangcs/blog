For this week's mounting motor project, I found a print on the junk shelf and wanted to utilize its motor to make a conveyor belt for sushi. It's a thing in Japanese restaurants.

## Making Process

Once I tested the motor and it works, I tried to figure out how to extend to make a conveyor belt with the setup. Also, what to make for its enclosure.

After making the enclosure for the structure of the conveyor belt, I made play-doh sushi for it.

## Demo Video

Instead of moving sushi, it's shaking all of them.
