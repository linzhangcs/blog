I like gifs a lot. I use them in my daily communication with family and friends. I have a gif keyboard installed on my phone. So it is very hard for me to pick only one gif to represent me. I feel my recent mood is about understanding myself and others. With that in mind, I used giphy and searched the sentence "I don't get it". Then I found a section of gifs that represents my internal feeling the best.

Here is the result:

![I don't get it]({{site.baseurl}}/images/magicWindow/idontgetit.gif)

Also gif was converted from a video capture of the website.
